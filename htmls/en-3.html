    <p>The food we eat seems to have profound effects on our health．Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat．Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses relate to diet and forty percent of cancer relates to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon．Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures．</p>
    <p>That food is connected with illness is not a new discovery．In 1945, about 35 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer．Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful．The additives which we eat are not all so direct．Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow．Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons．The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market．Although the Food and Drug Administration(FDA)has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue．</p>

    <h1>2021年12月四级阅读理解</h1>
    <p>A child who has once been pleased with a tale likes, as a rule, to have it retold in almost the same words, but this should not lead parents to treat printed fairly stories as formal texts. It is always much better to tell a story than read it out of a book, and if a parent can produce what, in the actual situation of the time and the child, is an improvement on the printed text, so much the better.</p>
    <p> A charge made against fairy tales is that they harm the child by frightening him or making him sad thinking. To prove the latter, one would have to show in a controlled experiment that children who have read fairy stories were more often sorry for cruelty than those who had not. As to fears, there are, in think, some cases of children being dangerously terrified by some fairy story. Often, however, this arises from the child having heard the story once. Familiarity with the story by repetition turns the pain of fear into the pleasure of a fear faces and mastered.</p>
    <p>There are also people who object to fairy stories on the grounds that they are not objectively true, that giants, witches, two-headed dragons, magic carpets, etc. do not exist; and that , instead of being fond of the strange side in fairy tales, the child should be taught to learn the reality by studying history. I find such people, I must say so peculiar that I do not know how to argue with them. If their case were sound, the world should be full of mad men attempting to fly from New York to Philadelphia on a stick or covering a telephone with kisses in the belief that it was their beloved girlfriend.</p>
    <p>No fairy story ever declared to be a description of the real world and no clever child has ever believed that it was.</p>
